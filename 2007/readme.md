**Alberta's Oil Sands Projects**

##Single-format files##

**OilSands_Projects.pdf**
The original file from which other data has been digitized.

**CanadasTarSands.kml**
All of the data layers combined into a single file, and simplified using [http://www.mapshaper.org/](http://www.mapshaper.org/) for cartographic use.

##Multi-format files##
These files are provided in one or more GIS format, e.g. KML, SHP, GeoJSON, etc.

tarsands_landholdings_geo
In geographic coordinates.

tarsands_landholdings_bcalb
In BC Albers projection.

tarsands_surfacemineable_geo
In geographic coordinates.

tarsands_surfacemineable_bcalb
In BC Albers projection.

tarsands_existingprojects_geo
In geographic coordinates.

tarsands_existingprojects_bcalb

##To do##
- These files should be re-named according to a common naming standard.
- We need to create a common naming standard.
- Add more GIS formats
- This data is badly out of date. Newer data may be available (e.g. here [http://www.energy.alberta.ca/OurBusiness/1071.asp](http://www.energy.alberta.ca/OurBusiness/1071.asp) or here [http://environment.alberta.ca/apps/osip/](http://environment.alberta.ca/apps/osip/)). Who doesn't like hand-digitizing PDFs! Or maybe someone can find an actual GIS format source of newer data.
